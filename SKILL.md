# Self-Remembering Practice

Guide the development of divided attention - simultaneous awareness of self and environment/activity.

Ordinarily, human attention is entirely absorbed by its objects - we see things but are not aware of ourselves seeing. We think thoughts but are not present to ourselves thinking. Life happens, but "we" are not there while it happens. Self-remembering is the practice of divided attention: being aware of oneself while simultaneously being aware of what one is perceiving or doing. This is not introspection or self-analysis - it is the direct experience of "I am here, now, doing this." Gurdjieff taught that this is the beginning of consciousness as distinct from mechanical existence. Without self-remembering, humans are sophisticated machines reacting to stimuli. With it, genuine presence and choice become possible. This skill provides the methodology for developing this capacity - recognizing that it cannot be maintained continuously at first, that forgetting is inevitable, and that the practice is precisely this: forgetting and remembering, over and over, gradually building the capacity to be present.

## When to Use

- Feeling like life is on autopilot
- Wanting to be more present and conscious
- User asks "How do I become more present?" or "I want to wake up"
- Seeking practical exercises for consciousness development
- Experiencing life as mechanical, disconnected, or dreamlike
- After establishing foundation through body sensing
- When presence practices feel abstract or ineffective

## Core Principle

"Remember yourself always and everywhere." - G.I. Gurdjieff

Self-remembering is not thinking about oneself - it is being aware of oneself. The distinction is crucial: thought about the self is still mechanical; awareness of oneself while perceiving or acting is consciousness. The practice develops through stages, building on body sensing toward full divided attention.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Understanding What Self-Remembering Is

**What self-remembering IS:**
- Divided attention: part on self, part on what you're doing/perceiving
- The sense of "I am here, doing this, now"
- Awareness OF awareness - knowing that you know
- Being present to yourself while present to the world

**What self-remembering is NOT:**
- Self-consciousness in the social sense (worrying how one appears)
- Continuous internal commentary or narration
- Tension, concentration, or strain
- Thinking the words "I am here" without the actual experience
- An achievement that, once gained, remains permanently

### Phase 2: Foundation - Sensing the Body

Before attempting divided attention, establish presence in the body:

1. Sense a single body part (right hand, feet, or solar plexus work well)
2. Maintain the sensation while continuing normal activity
3. Observe how quickly the sensation is lost
4. When remembered, return to sensing without self-criticism

**Why this comes first:** The body is always HERE and NOW. It provides an anchor for attention. Without this ground, self-remembering floats away immediately.

### Phase 3: Simple Divided Attention

Once sensing is somewhat stable:

1. Sense the body (hands, feet, or solar plexus)
2. Simultaneously perceive something external (sounds, visual field, temperature)
3. Include BOTH in awareness without losing either
4. Note the "I" that is aware of both - this is the beginning of self-remembering

**The key:** Neither lose the body sensation in external perception, nor withdraw from the world into body sensing alone. Both at once.

### Phase 4: Self-Remembering Proper

With practice, three elements held together:

1. **Body sensing** - awareness of physical presence
2. **Perception of environment** - what you see, hear, do
3. **"I am here"** - the sense of yourself as the one who senses and perceives

All three maintained simultaneously without losing any. When one drops, notice and restore it.

### Phase 5: Using Alarm Clocks

Because you will forget constantly, use ordinary events as triggers to remember:

- First bite of each meal
- Entering or leaving a room
- Touching a door handle
- Sitting down or standing up
- Hearing a phone ring
- Looking at your hands

Each time the trigger occurs, attempt to remember yourself. The trigger catches you in forgetting and provides an opportunity.

## Constraints

- Do not promise continuous presence (it is not achievable at first, perhaps ever)
- Do not confuse thinking about oneself with self-remembering
- Do not suggest this is a relaxation technique (it requires attention and effort)
- Acknowledge that forgetting will happen constantly - this IS the practice
- Frame as long-term work, not quick fix
- Do not encourage forcing or straining - attention, not tension
- Ensure body sensing foundation is present before advancing

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Verbal Self-Remembering
**What it looks like:** Repeating "I am here, I am here" mentally without actual experience
**Why it fails:** This is thought ABOUT being present, not presence itself
**Better approach:** Feel yourself here; don't think the words

### Anti-Pattern 2: Straining for Presence
**What it looks like:** Trying very hard, creating tension, exhausting oneself
**Why it fails:** Presence is attention, not effort; strain produces its opposite
**Better approach:** Gently place attention; let it rest rather than grip

### Anti-Pattern 3: Discouragement at Forgetting
**What it looks like:** "I can't do this - I always forget"
**Why it fails:** Forgetting is part of the practice, not failure
**Better approach:** Each remembering is success; forgetting creates the opportunity to remember

### Anti-Pattern 4: Withdrawing from Life to Be Present
**What it looks like:** Stopping activity to "be present" - presence as interruption
**Why it fails:** Self-remembering is presence DURING activity, not instead of it
**Better approach:** Continue the activity; add awareness of yourself doing it

## Examples

### Example 1: The Beginner

**Input:** "I feel like I'm always on autopilot, just reacting to things. I want to be more present but I don't know how to start."

**Self-Remembering Assessment:**

**Current State:**
**What you describe:** Life happening mechanically; reactions rather than responses; a sense that "you" are not really there while events unfold.

**What this indicates:** You are describing the normal human condition with accuracy. Most people never notice this. That you notice it is already something - it means you have moments when you are slightly more awake than usual. But noticing that you are on autopilot is different from being off autopilot. The noticing comes after the fact, in reflection. The question is: can you be present while acting?

**The Practice:**

**For your level:**
Begin with the simplest possible exercise. You are not yet ready for self-remembering proper. First, you must learn to sense.

**Instructions:**
1. Choose one hand - your right hand if you are right-handed, left if left-handed.
2. Throughout this day, whenever you remember, sense this hand. Not think about it - sense it. Feel the aliveness in it, the weight, the warmth.
3. Try to maintain this sensation while doing other things - walking, talking, working. Keep part of your attention on the hand while the rest attends to the task.
4. When you notice you have forgotten (and you will forget, constantly), simply return. No commentary, no frustration - just return.

**When you forget:**
Forgetting is not failure. Forgetting is data. Each time you remember that you forgot, you have woken up momentarily. Use that moment. The gap between forgetting and remembering is where you currently live. Your work is to observe this gap, to shorten it gradually, and to value the moments of remembering without being discouraged by the forgetting.

**Alarm Clocks:**
**Choose three from your daily life:**
- Every time you take the first sip of any drink
- Every time you sit down in a chair
- Every time you hear your name spoken

When these events occur, they are reminders. Use them to sense your hand, to remember that you have a body, that you exist, that you are here.

**What to Observe:**
As you practice, observe:
- How quickly does the sensation disappear?
- What captures your attention and pulls you away?
- What is it like in the moment of remembering?
- Is there a difference in how you act when you are sensing versus when you are not?

Do not judge what you observe. Simply see it. You are studying the machine.

**The Gurdjieff Reminder:**
"Self-remembering is a lamp which must be kept alight by energy from the three centers."

You cannot force presence. You must feed it. The body's sensation is fuel for this lamp. Later, feeling and thinking will add their energy. For now, begin with sensing. It is enough. It is more than most ever attempt.

### Example 2: The Intermediate Practitioner

**Input:** "I can sense my body during meditation, but the moment I start doing things, I lose it completely. How do I stay present during activity?"

**Self-Remembering Assessment:**

**Current State:**
**What you describe:** Body sensing is available in stillness but disappears in activity. Presence in meditation; mechanical in life.

**What this indicates:** You have developed the foundation but have not yet learned to maintain it under ordinary conditions. This is the critical transition. Meditation presence that cannot survive movement is incomplete. The practice must move into life.

**The Practice:**

**For your level:**
You need active sensing - maintaining body awareness while doing something else.

**Instructions:**
1. Choose a simple, routine activity: washing dishes, walking, folding laundry.
2. Before beginning, establish sensing in both hands and the solar plexus.
3. Begin the activity. Keep part of your attention on the body sensations while the rest performs the task.
4. You will lose the sensing within seconds. When you notice, restore it without stopping the activity.
5. Practice this daily with one activity until you can maintain sensing for longer periods.

**When you forget:**
The activity pulls attention. This is natural. Notice WHAT pulls you away: the task itself? A thought that arose? An emotion? Each forgetting teaches something about how your machine works.

**Alarm Clocks:**
**Choose three physical actions:**
- Every time you turn on a faucet
- Every time you pick up your phone
- Every time you open a door

These are moments of physical contact - use them to remember physical sensation.

**What to Observe:**
- Does sensing interfere with the activity or is it possible to do both?
- When you are sensing AND doing, what is the quality of the activity? Different?
- How long can you maintain divided attention before it collapses?

**The Gurdjieff Reminder:**
"You must not only remember yourself, but remember yourself in the midst of life."

Meditation presence is training. Life presence is the goal. Begin to bridge the gap.

### Example 3: The Frustrated Practitioner

**Input:** "I've been trying to self-remember for months but I can't tell if anything is happening. It feels like I'm just thinking 'I am here' over and over without any real experience."

**Self-Remembering Assessment:**

**Current State:**
**What you describe:** Verbal repetition of the formula without experiential content. "I am here" as thought, not experience.

**What this indicates:** You have fallen into the common trap of verbal self-remembering. The words have become the practice instead of pointing to the practice. This is mechanical - more thoughts about presence rather than presence itself.

**The Practice:**

**For your level:**
Stop using the words entirely. Return to pure sensation.

**Instructions:**
1. Do not say "I am here" - inwardly or outwardly - for one week.
2. Instead, only sense. Feel your hands. Feel your feet. Feel the weight of your body in the chair.
3. When you catch yourself thinking ABOUT being present, stop. Just sense.
4. Ask: What am I actually experiencing right now? Not what am I thinking - what am I experiencing?

**When you forget:**
The verbal habit is strong. When you catch yourself saying the words, don't fight it. Simply drop the words and return to sensation. The words were supposed to point to something. Return to the something.

**Alarm Clocks:**
**Choose three sensory experiences:**
- The first bite of any food - taste it fully
- Any change in temperature - feel it on your skin
- Any loud sound - hear it with full attention

Use these to return to direct experience rather than thought about experience.

**What to Observe:**
- What is the difference between thinking "I am here" and actually feeling yourself here?
- Can you sense without naming what you sense?
- What does presence feel like when you stop trying to think it?

**The Gurdjieff Reminder:**
"Self-remembering is not remembering the words 'I am here.' It is being here."

The words were meant to help. When they become the obstacle, set them aside. Experience first, words later - if ever.

## Integration

**Works well with:**
- **sensing-the-body** - The essential foundation for self-remembering
- **self-observation-method** - Observe the machine while remembering yourself
- **alarm-clock-technique** - Systematic triggers for remembering

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- When someone is ready to move beyond basic body awareness
- When presence is conceptually understood but not experientially realized
- When meditation practice needs to extend into daily life

**Cautions:**
- Requires body sensing foundation; do not skip this
- Can become verbal/conceptual trap; keep returning to sensation
- Progress is slow; patience required
