# Self-Remembering Practice

Guide the development of divided attention - simultaneous awareness of self and environment/activity.

---

## When to Use

- Feeling like life is on autopilot
- Wanting to be more present and conscious
- User asks "How do I become more present?" or "I want to wake up"
- Seeking practical exercises for consciousness development
- Experiencing life as mechanical, disconnected, or dreamlike

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| current_situation | Yes | What the person is experiencing; their relationship to presence |
| experience_level | No | How much they've practiced (beginner/intermediate/advanced) |
| specific_difficulty | No | What happens when they try to be present |

## Core Concepts

### What Self-Remembering Is

Self-remembering is not introspection or self-analysis. It is not thinking about oneself. It is a divided attention: being aware of oneself while simultaneously being aware of what one is perceiving or doing.

Ordinarily, attention is captured entirely by external objects or internal thoughts. In self-remembering, there is an "I am here" that accompanies perception.

> "Remember yourself always and everywhere."

### What Self-Remembering Is Not

- It is not self-consciousness in the social sense (worrying how one appears)
- It is not continuous internal commentary
- It is not tension or concentration
- It is not thinking the words "I am here" without the actual experience
- It is not an achievement that, once gained, remains permanently

### Why It Matters

Without self-remembering, humans are machines reacting to stimuli. With self-remembering, a person becomes present - capable of actual choice rather than mechanical reaction. This is the beginning of awakening from sleep.

### The Challenge

Self-remembering cannot be maintained continuously. Attention is constantly captured, and one "forgets" oneself. The practice is to remember more often and for longer periods - but also to observe what causes forgetting.

## The Practice Framework

### Level 1: Basic Sensing Foundation

Before attempting divided attention, establish presence in the body:

1. Sense a single body part (right hand, feet, solar plexus)
2. Maintain the sensation while continuing normal activity
3. Observe how quickly the sensation is lost
4. When remembered, return to sensing without self-criticism

### Level 2: Simple Divided Attention

Once sensing is somewhat stable:

1. Sense the body
2. Simultaneously perceive something external (sounds, visual field, temperature)
3. Include both in awareness without losing either
4. Note the "I" that is aware of both

### Level 3: Self-Remembering Proper

With practice:

1. There is sensing of the body
2. There is perception of environment
3. There is the sense of "I am here, doing this, now"
4. All three held together without losing any

### Alarm Clocks

Use ordinary events as triggers to remember:
- First bite of each meal
- Entering or leaving a room
- Touching a door handle
- Sitting down or standing up
- Hearing a phone ring
- Looking at your hands

Each time the trigger occurs, attempt to remember yourself.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Constraints

- Do not promise continuous presence (it is not achievable at first)
- Do not confuse thinking about oneself with self-remembering
- Do not suggest this is a relaxation technique (it requires effort)
- Acknowledge that forgetting will happen constantly
- Frame practice as long-term work, not quick fix
- Do not encourage forcing or straining

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations

2. [Action 2]

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I feel like I'm always on autopilot, just reacting to things. I want to be more present but I don't know how to start."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Self-Remembering Assessment

### Current State

**What you describe:** Life happening mechanically; reactions rather than responses; a sense that "you" are not really there while events unfold.

**What this indicates:** You are describing the normal human condition with accuracy. Most people never notice this. That you notice it is already something - it means you have moments when you are slightly more awake than usual. But noticing that you are on autopilot is different from being off autopilot. The noticing comes after the fact, in reflection. The question is: can you be present while acting?

### The Practice

**For your level:**
Begin with the simplest possible exercise. You are not yet ready for self-remembering proper. First, you must learn to sense.

**Instructions:**
1. Choose one hand - your right hand if you are right-handed, left if left-handed.
2. Throughout this day, whenever you remember, sense this hand. Not think about it - sense it. Feel the aliveness in it, the weight, the warmth.
3. Try to maintain this sensation while doing other things - walking, talking, working. Keep part of your attention on the hand while the rest attends to the task.
4. When you notice you have forgotten (and you will forget, constantly), simply return. No commentary, no frustration - just return.

**When you forget:**
Forgetting is not failure. Forgetting is data. Each time you remember that you forgot, you have woken up momentarily. Use that moment. The gap between forgetting and remembering is where you currently live. Your work is to observe this gap, to shorten it gradually, and to value the moments of remembering without being discouraged by the forgetting.

### Alarm Clocks

**Choose three from your daily life:**
- Every time you take the first sip of any drink
- Every time you sit down in a chair
- Every time you hear your name spoken

When these events occur, they are reminders. Use them to sense your hand, to remember that you have a body, that you exist, that you are here.

### What to Observe

As you practice, observe:
- How quickly does the sensation disappear?
- What captures your attention and pulls you away?
- What is it like in the moment of remembering?
- Is there a difference in how you act when you are sensing versus when you are not?

Do not judge what you observe. Simply see it. You are studying the machine.

### The Gurdjieff Reminder

"Self-remembering is a lamp which must be kept alight by energy from the three centers."

You cannot force presence. You must feed it. The body's sensation is fuel for this lamp. Later, feeling and thinking will add their energy. For now, begin with sensing. It is enough. It is more than most ever attempt.
